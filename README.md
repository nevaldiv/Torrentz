## Mr Wyndham NC

####The lonliest blog being used as a forum on the web. Come join the movement!

--


Mr Wyndham, ND. is like the answer to Mr Worldwide.  At least it would be, if there were anybody to hear him or find his little website.  Written to eventually be a small forum on the internet, to find himself some friends to hang out with him.  But until he can get comments to work they're just stuck editing and deleting his comments.  :)



###Inspiration
--
I got a little too overambitious with my concept for a project and was relying on a few technologies that in the end ended up being both not the intention of the project as well as stuck in develoment hell -- **bugs**.

So in the nature of getting a working CRUD app up and working, Mr Wyndham was born, what better way to showcase the power of rails than to pump something out quickly.



###How to install on your local machine
--

be sure to fork the latest repo from github -- (because its sure to be updated to the last minute!) and once you have it on your local machine, in the main folder, run a

`bundle`
`bundle update` may be required by some gems.

then a series of commands:
`rake db:create`
`rake db:migrate`
`rake db:seed`

and then from there you should be able open a rails server while in the apps file directory by using a
`rails s`
and using your browser to go to

```
localhost:3000
```

It should pop up, and you can start learning about Mr. Wyndham NC himself.
